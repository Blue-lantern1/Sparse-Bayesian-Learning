# Sparse-Bayesian-Learning

Course: EE798L: Machine Learning for Wireless Communications
– Generated design matrix with standard gaussian entries, generated sparse vector, generated observation vector incorporating the above with noise.
– Applied SBL for regression to get MAP estimate of the sparse vector. Considered NMSE for performance.
